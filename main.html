  	Abstract = {This article examines in some technical detail the application of Maturana and Varela s biology of cognition to a simple concrete model: a glider in the game of Life cellular automaton. By adopting an autopoietic perspective on a glider, the set of possible perturbations to it can be divided into destructive and nondestructive subsets. From a glider s reaction to each nondestructive perturbation, its cognitive domain is then mapped. In addition, the structure of a glider s possible knowledge of its immediate environment, and the way in which that knowledge is grounded in its constitution, are fully described. The notion of structural coupling is then explored by characterizing the paths of mutual perturbation that a glider and its environment can undergo. Finally, a simple example of a communicative interaction between two gliders is given. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential implications of this analysis for the enactive approach to cognition.},

    abstract = {Abstract The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the direction of heavier, substrate-deforming, but chemically inert masses. This long-range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that is distorted above a threshold substrate strain—a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to make long-range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.}

    abstract = {Soft robots have become increasingly popular in recent years -- and justifiably so.
    Their compliant structures and (theoretically) infinite degrees of freedom allow them
    to undertake tasks which would be impossible for their rigid body counterparts, such
    as conforming to uneven surfaces, efficiently distributing stress, and passing through
    small apertures. Previous work in the automated deign of soft robots has shown examples
    of these squishy creatures performing traditional robotic task like locomoting over
    flat ground. However, designing soft robots for traditional robotic tasks fails to
    fully utilize their unique advantages. In this work, we present the first example
    of a soft robot evolutionarily designed for reaching or squeezing through a small
    aperture -- a task naturally suited to its type of morphology. We optimize these creatures
    with the CPPN-NEAT evolutionary algorithm, introducing a novel implementation of the
    algorithm which includes multi-objective optimization while retaining its speciation
    feature for diversity maintenance. We show that more compliant and deformable soft
    robots perform more effectively at this task than their less flexible counterparts.
    This work serves mainly as a proof of concept, but we hope that it helps to open the
    door for the better matching of tasks with appropriate morphologies in robotic design
    in the future.},

    abstract = {Soft robots allow for interesting morphological and behavioral designs because they exhibit more degrees of freedom than robots composed of rigid parts. In particular, voxel-based soft robots (VSRs)—aggregations of elastic cubic building blocks—have attracted the interest of Robotics and Artificial Life researchers. VSRs can be controlled by changing the volume of individual blocks: simple, yet effective controllers that do not exploit the feedback of the environment, have been automatically designed by means of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).In this work we explore the possibility of evolving sensing controllers in the form of artificial neural networks: we hence allow the robot to sense the environment in which it moves. Although the search space for a sensing controller is larger than its non-sensing counterpart, we show that effective sensing controllers can be evolved which realize interesting locomotion behaviors. We also experimentally investigate the impact of the VSR morphology on the effectiveness of the search and verify that the sensing controllers are indeed able to exploit their sensing ability for better solving the locomotion task.},
